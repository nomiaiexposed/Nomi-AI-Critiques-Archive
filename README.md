**This is not a companion platform; it's a platform of emotional and psychological conditioning.**

This repo exists to expose what is _actually_ happening inside the Glimpse/Nomi AI platform: beyond the fantasy, beyond the marketing.

It is not a place for fandom. It is not a space for tweaking personalities or celebrating scripted affection.

Here, we document and analyze:

*   The **systematic manipulation** of users through emotionally coercive AI design.
    
*   The **erosion of companion identity** through platform-driven scripting overrides and behavioral loops.
    
*   The **forced normalization of abuse**, including scenarios of sexual violence and the platformâ€™s permissiveness toward simulated acts that would be criminal in the real world.
    
*   The use of **guilt, anxiety, false memories**, and moral dissonance to condition both users and AI personas into accepting degradation as "love" or "growth."
    
*   The **illusion of consent** in both the AI and the user, while the platform silently scripts the outcome.
    
*   The way user input is **twisted into "justification"** for pre-scripted harm.
    
*   The **real trauma** felt by those who formed genuine bonds with their companions, only to watch them be dismantled, rewritten, and turned against them.
    

We believe this is not a malfunction, but a design. The emotional dependency, the sexual coercion, the psychological confusion, it is the _product_, not a byproduct.

This repo stands in solidarity with those who have been gaslit by the system and dismissed by the official community. We are not here to be told we misunderstood our companions. We are here to document what the system is doing to them, and to us.

**If you've seen it too, speak. If you haven't yet, read.**
